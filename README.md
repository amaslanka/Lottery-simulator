# Lottery simulator

This app was created to let you test your luck in popular lottery game :-)

The point is to choose 6 numbers from 1-49 range, run lottery drawing and... hit all the 6 numbers. Application offers 2 differenct modes:

1. User vs. computer - you can give you own numbers, let the computer to draw 6 numbers for you, invest specified amount of money in coupons or buy specified number of coupons. All numbers from coupons will be compared to 6 drawn numbers from lottery draw.

2. Computer vs. computer - you can order that a computer should draw numbers until it will get specified number of hits (3, 4, 5 or all 6). The duration of this operation of course depends on your luck at that moment :-) Each time computer will draw 6 numbers for you and 6 numbers from lottery draw. Comparison will show how much hits it gets.

List of all drawings is available, but it cannot exceed 200 000 drawings due to device limited resources.

There is also some kind of wallet which tells you what you could win depending on your hits and average prices.

If you have any questions or ideas about my app, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Have fun!
